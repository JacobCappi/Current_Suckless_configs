/sys/class fetches

/power_supply/BAT0 [only have 1 battery]
    -> acpi had a nice interface, and gave me times [charge until and deplete]
        acpi -V | head -n 2 | awk '{$1="";$2="";print}'

timedatectl has basic interface for time:
"date" actually does : date +%R\ %F

I'm using pactl for volume, so I think I can query for volume %

pactl list sinks {need to check mute and vol}

found brightness in /sys/class/acpi_video : would like as percent
    brightness is current from 0 - max
    max is set at 15 (unsure what that really means, but easy percent.
    getBrightness is just brightness / max
    -> division ended up bad, just gonna print the brightness

Weather works, but makes the bar much slower (I have a ping, curl, write, then read, w/ time) [about 0.7 sec]
    with all the writes and reads + network check and curling, I don't know how to make it work in 0.2 sec (...)
    -> unsure how to make this faster (?), also, how to update less often.

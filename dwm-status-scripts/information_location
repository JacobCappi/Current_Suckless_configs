/power_supply/BAT0 [only have 1 battery]
    -> acpi had a nice interface, and gave me times [charge until and deplete]
        acpi -V | head -n 1 | awk '{$1="";$2="";print}'

timedatectl has basic interface for time:
"date" actually does : date +%R\ %F

I'm using pactl for volume, so I think I can query for volume %

pactl list sinks {need to check mute and vol}
